# Skew-T Analysis

The Skew-T Log-P diagram, or "Skew-T\" for short, is a type of plot specific
to meteorology that is frequently used in the analysis of vertical profiles of
temperature and humidity. For instance, the data collected by weather balloons
in 12-hourly soundings are often shown with such plots, as they foster an
understanding of e.g. the stability of the atmosphere above a location.

The units in this chapter show ways to use MetPy to generate skew-T plots and
customize them with various pieces of information.
